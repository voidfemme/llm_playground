Here are a few things you could check:\n\n1. Make sure you are properly parsing the API response. Check if the response format matches what your application expects.\n\n2. Look for any error messages or stack traces in your application's logs. They might provide clues about what caused the crash.\n\n3. Verify that your application can handle the volume and rate of API requests you are sending. Check if there are any rate limits or throttling in place.\n\n4. Test your application with different input messages to see if the crash occurs consistently or only with specific content.\n\n5. If you have access to the API documentation, double-check that you are using the correct endpoints, request methods, and parameters.\n\nRemember, I'm here to assist you throughout your testing process. Feel free to send more messages or provide additional details about the crash, and I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot the issue. Good luck with your project!",
